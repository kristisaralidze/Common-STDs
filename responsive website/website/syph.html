                                affects approximately 296 million people, including over 6 million children under the age of 5. Hepatitis B contributes to an estimated 820,000 deaths every year. <br>
                                <b>Is syphilis 100% curable?</b> <br>
                                Yes. Your healthcare provider can treat syphilis with antibiotics. Antibiotics will cure the infection, but there’s no way to repair organs damaged by syphilis. <br>
                                <b>How can I reduce my risk of getting syphilis?</b> <br>
                                The only way to prevent syphilis (and other STIs) is to abstain from sex. If you’re sexually active, you can reduce your risk of infection by always using a condom or dental dam during sex.

                <textarea class="scrollabletextbox" name="note" >Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by Treponema Pallidum, but there are at least three more known species causing human treponemal diseases such as Treponema pertenue that causes yaws, Treponema carateum causing pinta and Treponema pallidum endemicum-responsible for bejel or endemic syphilis. From the very beginningdisgraceful disease; each country whose population was affected by the infection blamed the neighboring (and sometimes enemy).Having syphilis once does not protect you from getting it again. Even after successful treatment, you can get syphilis again. Only laboratory tests can confirm whether you have syphilis. Follow-up testing by your healthcare provider is necessary to make sure your treatment was successful. It may not be obvious that a sex partner has syphilis. Syphilis sores in the vagina, anus, mouth, or under the foreskin of the penis, can be hard to see. You may get syphilis again, if your sex partner(s) does not receive testing and treatment.Having syphilis once does not protect you from getting it again. Even after successful treatment, you can get syphilis again. Only laboratory tests can confirm whether you have syphilis. Follow-up testing by your healthcare provider is necessary to make sure your treatment was successful.Without treatment, syphilis can lead to damage throughout your body. Syphilis also increases the risk of HIV infection and can cause problems during pregnancy. Treatment can help prevent future damage but can't repair or reverse damage that's already occurred.
